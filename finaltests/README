We implemented the Hex Game with AI using Monte Carlo method and chose to do socket programming.

THREE WAYS TO IMPLEMENT THE GAME

-----------------1--------------------------
The easiest way to test this is to go to 105 and open two windows. 
Open two windows in the unix server. 
1.) Compile using make in any of the windows.
2.) Run the server by typing in one window  ./simple_server 
3.) Run the client in the other window    ./simple_client

* You have to run server before client!


-----------------2--------------------------

If you are using putty or some ssh. (Sometimes will work if you are lucky!) 
Open two windows in the unix server. 
1.) Compile using make in any of the windows.
2.) Run the server by typing in one window  ./simple_server 
3.) Run the client in the other window    ./simple_client

* You have to run server before client!

-----------------3--------------------------

If you are still using putty or some ssh.
If putty doesn't connect here is what you need to do.

1.) You need two windows. 
2.) Open first window and run ipconfig then go open the 2nd window on putty and
type in your cruzid@ipaddress where the ip address is what the other window gave you.
3.) Compile using make in any of the windows.
4.) Run the server by typing in one window  ./simple_server 
5.) Run the client in the other window    ./simple_client 

EXAMPLE:
WINDOW 1
ipconfig

WINDOW
login: yourcruzid@ipaddress
