compile command:

make

run command: piC   then enter an int when prompted 


This program takes in a number and cacluates PI basied on the number of trials the user inputs.

the origonal file did not include srand() and the instructions did not explicitly say that we needed srand.
I learned how to use inline, I could see why it would be slightly more efficent than making function calls. Although It was not implemented here, I learned how to use auto in my for loops. It is a very easy and fast way to traverse the vector. Also I learned that this program when written in C can still be compiled in C++ and run without error. Lastly
