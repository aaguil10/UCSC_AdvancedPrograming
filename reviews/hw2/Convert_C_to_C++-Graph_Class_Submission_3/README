Converted from C includes:
- matrix representation
- calloc replace by vector and resize
- printf goes to use of "<<"
- struct becomes class
- advanced make_  becomes a constructor
- use <random> instead of rand() and srand()
- change to one line comments
- change 2D array to vector
- inline short function

What I have learn via this assignment are the new Random class, 
how to declare, define and reference class objects.
