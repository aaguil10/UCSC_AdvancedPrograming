The program runs with the name "graph".

In doing this program, I was able to re-familiarize myself with parts specific to object oriented programming, namely classes and constructors.  Also, I feel that this program helped me see more of how vector<> works compared to array[].  I wasn't quite able to get the hang of operator overload for the print function, so I will still need to work on that.
