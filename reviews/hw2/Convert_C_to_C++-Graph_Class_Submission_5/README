Assignment 2

My second attempt at using C++, this program was
more difficult for me than the last. I tried and
failed at learning to utilize advanced random n-
umber generators, and also two dimensional vect-
ors. I will keep trying. I succeeded in using t-
he C++ <new> and found my way around class stru-
cture, pointers on top of pointers, scope, and  
the two dimensional array I ended up using. 

Three files are included:
-README (the one you are reading)
-makefile
-rgraph.cpp

Compilation instructions:
-use command "make" to compile
-executable will be called "rgraph"

Program:
-prints two pseudo-random matrices
