To run this program, use the Makefile I provided. Just type 
"make" in the command line on the Unix server. It will make an 
executable called "matrix" that you run.

For this project I had to convert a C program to C++. Structs had
to become classes. It needed to use IOstream, and a constructor
for the class "graph". For a 2 dimensional array, I used a 2D
vector.

I made one class called graph that held all the data needed to 
make the graph. It also had a constructor that set the size, 
density, and placed all the boolean values in the matrix. That 
was the bulk of the work. The program just makes 2 graphs, and 
then prints them out.

I learned all about C++ classes and how to use them. I had no 
clue how to make constructors in C++ before this project. I also
learned how to use vectors which Professor Pohl says is important!
