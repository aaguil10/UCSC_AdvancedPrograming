CMPS109 - HW2 Dijkstras and Bidirectional Search

I had issues getting started on the program and was confused on how to implement the search algorithms.  I've added the randomly generated
weights but could not get my dijktras to work so I didn't do the bidirectional alogrithm. I have the program just printing out the vertex and weight 
since the shortest path algorithm's weren't working.
