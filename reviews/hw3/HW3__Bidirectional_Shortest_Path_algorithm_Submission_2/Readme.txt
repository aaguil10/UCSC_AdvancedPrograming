// HW3 - Dijkstra Implementation

I had alot of trouble with this for some reason. I understand the algorithm and can do it on paper but I was unable to actually implement it for some time. My intuition told me that the bi-directional search should take the same amount of time, if not more, because I am searching through closed list for specific nodes.
