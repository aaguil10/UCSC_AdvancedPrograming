Dijkstra’s and bi-directional Dijkstra’s algorithm.

What went right:
We successfully implemented Dijkstra’s and semi-successfully implemented bi-directional Dijkstra’s.

What went wrong:
The algorithms that we wrote are both grossly inefficient. 
The algorithm for Dijkstra’s runs at an average of 2.8 seconds per trial for a 1000 node graph, while the algorithm for Bi-directional runs at an average of 10 seconds on a 2.7 Ghz processor.

If we had to estimate, we would guess we are running at greater than n^2 runtime. :|

The algorithm worked and returns success, but could be optimized if written again.

TO COMPILE:
---------------

run gmake with Makefile and main.cpp on Unix timeshare.
