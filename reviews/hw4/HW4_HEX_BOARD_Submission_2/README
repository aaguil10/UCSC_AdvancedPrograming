 Assignment 4

 This program plays the game HEX by itself, in a dumb way. 
It will build a blank game board, then randomly distribute 
moves across the board until no moves remain. Then it 
determines which player has won the game. 

 In particular, this exact file as I submit it will play and
print four games, in the board dimensions mentioned on the
HEX Wikipedia page. 

 I learned to implement a breadth first search. I got better 
at working with the STL list and STL vector. I would have liked
a better method of checking for connections than the six if
statements I used, but I have a midterm in another class to study 
for and couldn't think of a better way.
