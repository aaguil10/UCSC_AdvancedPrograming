Material learned/Program details
	
	I implemented the hexBoard using a 2d vector (which made sense to me at the time i started the program). This resulted in me needing 2 variables (an X and a Y) to keep track of neighbor nodes.
	It is the reason I have pairs of variables. 
	learned how to use class. class is used to make an object. objectect orientated programm is cleaner and more organized. Also learned how to overload an operator.
	In this program specifically I overloaded the << to print out my hex board.

Player 1 can only win left to right
Player 2 can only win top to bottom


printed hexBoard looks like this:


	 hexBoard size 11
