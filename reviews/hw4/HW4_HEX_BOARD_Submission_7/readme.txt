The code is a simple implementation of Hex game. It creates the graph and the user can play as one player. The code asks user whether he/she wants to play against another player or play against AI. 
The code checks for the winner after each move made by either player.

By doing this assignment I’ve learned how to implement a table of vectors and how to create a simple AI.
