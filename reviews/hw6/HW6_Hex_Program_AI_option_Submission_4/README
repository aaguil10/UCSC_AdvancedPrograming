CMPS109 - FINAL PROJECT

AI Game of Hex that uses networking(sockets)

References:

Files:
game.cpp
game.h
hexBoard.h
hexGraph.h
hexGraph.cpp
main.cpp
server.cpp
Makefile
Readme

Notes:
-We use a const 10000 Monte Carlo iterations for each game
-The AI works just fine but we could not get the networking portion to work correctly with the game so what it does is
Start a connection
Acknowledge the connection
Play the game on the client
and then relay the winner to the server

How to Compile:
Open two terminals.  In each go into the directory where all the files are.
On terminal 1 type: g++ -std=c++11 -o server server.cpp
on terminal 2 type: make
On terminal 1 type: ./server 20001
on terminal 2 type: client 127.0.0.1 20001

Then begin playing!
*if server responds with "ERROR on binding: Address already in use" just add 1 to the port address, so 20002 instead of 200001 and so on
