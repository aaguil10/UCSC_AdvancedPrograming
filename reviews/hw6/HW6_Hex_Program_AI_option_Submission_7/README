HW6 HEX GAME WITH GUI
*************************************************************

Partner with James Kuch (forgot to handshake)

So for this project we decided to make the hex game with a GUI. To play 
you simply pick a color first (either red or blue). Red will go first 
and of course the AI will play the opposite. To play you simply use 
WASD to move and R to fill the spot your cursor is on. You can also 
hit Q to reset the board. You have to decide on a color on the console 
before you can see the board.
V 1.1: "Swapping" should work now, whoever goes second has the option to play
over their opponent's space- just for that one turn. 

Warning the load time for AI moves is kind of slow but it works.

How to Run
have all of the files in the same folder and type gmake all of make.
Tested on the Unix timeshare-login with ssh -X (ucscid)@unix.ucsc.edu
